# AI Interview Service API

## Overview
The **AI Interview Service API** is a powerful tool designed to revolutionize the recruitment process. It's a comprehensive platform that automates and enhances several key stages, from candidate data extraction to post-interview analysis. This service leverages the power of Gemini AI to generate dynamic interview questions, evaluate candidate responses, and provide insightful feedback, helping you make smarter, faster hiring decisions.

## Key Features

- **Video Interview Analysis**: Processes interview video data by converting videos to audio and transcribing speech to text. This enables the system to understand and analyze the content of the interview.
- **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Utilizes Gemini AI to create relevant and dynamic interview questions based on the transcribed text, ensuring a tailored and effective interview experience.
- **Automated Response Evaluation**: Evaluates user responses, assigns a score, and analyzes behavioral aspects to provide comprehensive and objective feedback.
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Generates detailed reports that include a score, analysis of communication style, and insights into key soft skills, helping you get a complete picture of the candidate.
