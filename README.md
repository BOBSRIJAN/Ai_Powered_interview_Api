# AI Interview Service API
   
    This project is an AI-powered Interview Service API designed to streamline the recruitment process. It extracts text from user CVs (supporting PDF and DOCX formats) and stores the data in MongoDB for easy retrieval. The system processes interview video data by converting videos to audio, transcribing speech to text, and generating relevant questions and answers using Gemini AI. After the interview, it evaluates user responses, assigns marks, and analyzes behavioral aspects to provide comprehensive feedback.
